## Restore stock partition table

### Why is this needed?

If you want to uninstall windows this is used instead of deleting partitions manually to avoid human error + writing a whole dedicated guide to just uninstalling.

If you want to relock your bootloader you'll need your partition table to be stock.

### Dependencies

[gpt_both0.bin](../../../../releases/tag/binaries)

### Notes

> Replace ```<gpt_both0.bin>``` with the path to the gpt_both0.bin file.


## Restore GPT

```cmd
fastboot flash partition:0 <gpt_both0.bin>
```

## Erase userdata to avoid bootloop and restore FS size
```cmd
fastboot -w
```
