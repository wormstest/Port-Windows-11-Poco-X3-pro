## Status
- On this page you can see which components are working and which not.
- This status is provided for informational purposes only and in no way represents any commitment that all features will be available or development will ever be completed. You shouldn't buy a device for the sole purpose of running Windows on it with the hope that it will eventually be fully functional.
- Development of new drivers for POCO X3 Pro is currently frozen, so support for some components (such as audio) will not be added in the near future.
- You can also follow the development of the project in [Telegram chat](https://t.me/winonvayu).
